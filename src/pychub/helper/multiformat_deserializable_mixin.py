class MultiformatDeserializableMixin:
    """
    A mixin class that provides deserialization capabilities from multiple formats like JSON, YAML, and TOML.

    Details:
        This mixin enables subclasses to deserialize data from different text-based serialization formats
        into Python objects. Subclasses must implement the `from_mapping` method to specify how to build
        an instance from a mapping. The mixin also provides hook methods to allow customizing the
        deserialization steps, such as preprocessing mappings or postprocessing instances.
